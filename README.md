# Pac-Man with Bombs!

## How to Compile on macOS
The easiest way to compile this project on macOS is with [Homebrew] and [CMake].

1. [Install Homebrew] if you have not already.
1. Install CMake, [SDL2], [SDL2_ttf], and [OpenSSL] with Homebrew:
   ```
   brew install cmake sdl2 sdl2_ttf openssl
   ```
1. Download this repository and `cd` into it.
1. Run CMake:
   ```
   cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build
   ```

## How to Play
1. Run the executable in `bin`:
   ```
   ./bin/main
   ```

You control the yellow square. Use the W, A, S, and D keys to go up, left, down, and right, respectively. Red squares are fruit. You can eat fruit by moving over them. An FPS counter in the top-right corner tells you how the game is performing on your system; the higher the number, the better.

1. Make the map more like a maze than an empty grid
1. Add enemies

## Todo - Matt
